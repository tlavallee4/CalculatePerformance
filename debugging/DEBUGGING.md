# Debugging Analysis

## Scenario 1: Attempting to debug profitOrLoss calculated correctly

-   **Breakpoint Location:** Line 17
-   **Objective:** Trying to test the debugger to see how it works and also check if profitOrLoss is calculated correctly with inputs

### Debugger Observations

-   **Variable States:** None
-   **Call Stack:** Paused on exception
-   **Behavior:** nothing in the debug console as well. confused on how this works. I've never been shown how to do this and can't find in the notes.

### Analysis

-   What did you learn from this scenario?
-   Did you observe any unexpected behavior? If so, what might be the cause?
-   Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?
-   How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?
